kano-screenshot
===============

Helper tool to take screenshots in Kanux.

It is based on the tool raspi2png from Andrew:

  https://github.com/AndrewFromMelbourne/raspi2png

It can take screenshots of applications drawing on different layers
of the RaspberryPI GPU surfaces, where other tools like scrot cannot.

This is the case with applications like Minecraft.
